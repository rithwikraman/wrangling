        "  1. Read the abstract. What is this paper about?\n",
        "\n",
        "This paper is about data tidying and provides a framework to make it easier to tidy messy datasets. The framework this paper provides also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for analysis.  \n",
        "\n",
        "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish?\n",
        "\n",
        "It is intended to facilitate an initial exploration and analysis of the data, and to simplify the development of data development tools that work well together.\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, itâ€™s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "The first quote means that tidy datasets provide a standardized approach to combine dataset structure (such as the number of rows and columns) with its meaning. Messy datasets, however, are messy in their own unique ways. Some are missing values, others have duplicate entries, etc.\n",

        "The second quote means that it is difficult to provide a standardized definition of what observations and variables are.\n",
        "\n",
        "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations?\n",
        "\n",
        "Values are either numbers or strings, organized in two ways: variables and observations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Variables contain all values that measure the same underlying attribute (height, temperature, duration, etc.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Observations contain all values measured on the same unit (person, day, race) across attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "  5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3?\n",
        "\n",
        "Tidy Data is defined as: 1) Each variable forms a column. 2) Each observation forms a row, 3) Each type of observational unit forms a table.\n",
        "\n",
        "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Column headers are values, not variable names\n",
        "- Multiple variables are stored in one column\n",
        "- Variables are stored in both rows and columns\n",
        "- Mulptiple types of observational units are stored in the same table\n",
        "- A single observational unit is stored in multiple units\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
        "\n",
        "Table 11 is messy because it contains missing values in many of the cells. Table 12 fixes this by omitting missing values to save space, but the \"element\" column contains names instead of variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?\n",
        "\n",
        "If tidy tools is only as useful as the tools that work with it, then tidy tools will be inextricably linked to tidy data. Wickham hopes that long-term, concerted effort will be taken to break out of the \"local maxima\" where \"independently changing data structures or data tools will not improve workflow\". He hopes that others will build on the data tidying framework he has outliend to enhance data storage tools and strategies."
